DESCRIPTION=This library allows your Java program to interface very easily with the Python world. It uses the Pyro protocol to call methods on remote objects. (See https://github.com/irmen/Pyro4). To that end, it also contains and uses a feature complete pickle protocol implementation -read and write- to exchange data with Pyro/Python. Pyrolite only implements part of the client side Pyro library, hence its name 'lite'... But because Pyrolite has no dependencies, it is a much lighter way to use Pyro from Java/.NET than a solution with jython+pyro or IronPython+Pyro would provide. So if you don't need Pyro's full feature set, and don't require your Java/.NET code to host Pyro objects itself, Pyrolite may be a good choice to connect java or .NET and python. (More info about Pyro itself: https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/ ) Version 4.30 changes: Support for unpickling protocol 5 pickles with out-of-band buffers (Python 3.8)
